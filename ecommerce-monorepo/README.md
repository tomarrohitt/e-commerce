# Local Setup Guide

This project is a microservices-based e-commerce system. You will:

- Clone the repo
- Configure environment variables
- Start infrastructure (DB, cache, broker)
- Run the unified setup script

> ** Important:** If you skip steps or half-configure secrets, things will break. Follow the order.

---

## 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tomarrohitt/e-commerce ecommerce-microservice
cd ecommerce-microservice
```

---

## 2️⃣ Configure Environment Variables

Each service has its own `.env` file.

Instead of manually copying them one by one, run:

```bash
# Linux / macOS
for dir in apps/*; do
  if [ -f "$dir/.env.example" ]; then
    cp "$dir/.env.example" "$dir/.env"
  fi
done
```

Now edit the `.env` files and fill in the required secrets.

> **⚠️ Note:** If you leave required secrets empty, related features will fail.

---

## 🔐 Required Secrets

These are mandatory for full functionality.

### AWS S3 (Image Uploads)

**Used by:** Identity, Catalog, Invoice services.

```env
AWS_REGION=your_region
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
```

> **Without this:**
>
> - Profile image upload will fail
> - Product image upload will fail

### SMTP (Email Service)

**Used by:** Email service.

```env
SMTP_HOST=smtp-relay.brevo.com
SMTP_SECURE=false
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your_smtp_user
SMTP_PASS=your_smtp_password
SMTP_FROM=your_verified_sender_email
```

> **Without this:**
>
> - Registration emails won't send
> - Order confirmation emails won't send

### Stripe (Payments)

**Used by:** Orders service.

```env
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
```

> **Without this:**
>
> - Checkout won't work
> - Webhooks will fail
> - Orders won't confirm properly

---

## 3️⃣ Start Infrastructure

This project depends on:

- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- RabbitMQ

Start them with Docker:

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres redis rabbitmq
```

> **⚠️ Important:**
>
> - This does NOT start application services.
> - It only starts infrastructure.
> - You can point services to managed cloud instances instead by editing `.env`.

---

## 4️⃣ Install and Run Everything

Run the unified setup script from the project root:

```bash
pnpm run setup
```

This script will:

1. Install all dependencies
2. Generate Prisma clients
3. Run database migrations
4. Build shared packages
5. Start all services

> **💡 If this fails:**
>
> Don't retry blindly. Read the error. It's almost always:
>
> - Missing env variable
> - Database not running
> - Port conflict

---

## 🌐 Service Ports

After successful startup, services will run on:

- `4000` – `4005`
- `5000`
